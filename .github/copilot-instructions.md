Check ./case-oppgave.txt for instructions on what the assignment is about.

I'm creating a next.js front end, and a python fastapi backend. 
Using a postgresql database, through docker compose.

Keep the code simple, and the project structure clean. the main point of the project is to show architectural design and ci/cd pipelines, infrastructure and deployment, not to show off complex code.

the dataset we have to work with is in ./dataset.csv .

For the frontend we use tailwind and shadcn, install components as you see fit.
